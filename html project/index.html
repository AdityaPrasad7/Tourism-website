    <h2>History of bhubaneswar</h2>
    <div class="description">Bhubaneswar, a city with a history spanning over 3,000 years, stands as a testament to India's ancient heritage. It was a prominent center of the Kalinga kingdom and witnessed the historic Kalinga War in the 3rd century BCE, an event that led Emperor Ashoka to embrace Buddhism. The city is renowned for its exquisite temples, notably the Lingaraja Temple dating back to the 11th century, showcasing architectural marvels from ancient times. During the medieval era, Bhubaneswar thrived under various dynasties like the Gangas and Marathas. In the post-independence era, it was chosen as the capital of Odisha in 1948, leading to planned urban development. Today, Bhubaneswar is not just a historical treasure trove but also a modern economic and educational hub, reflecting the harmonious blend of its rich past and rapid modernization, making it a vibrant cultural and economic center in eastern India.</div>
